With back-to-work you can create a high availability cluster with in active-standby failover configuration. Since it's written from a sysadmin for sysadmins the language of choice is posix shell script to enable portable, compact and customizable code.

Actually it works on Linux, HP-UX, OpenBSD, CYGWIN, ESXi. You can even mix OS in you cluster for example you can configure a package (set of resources) to move an IP between a Linux host and a OpenBSD host with the same package configuration.
Other OS will be supported as I will be able to try them.

I'm looking for some help in the development so if you are interested contact me by email, any kind of help is welcome (test, feedback, new code, patches, wiki).

NOTE: back-to-work depends on dex-lock. you should download
both and copy them in the same directory.
